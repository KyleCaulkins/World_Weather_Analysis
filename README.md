# World_Weather_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to aid in a project for PlanMyTrip, a web based travel company. The project is for PlanMyTrip's user interface team. Web patrons are able to input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which are used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the user is able to choose cities and create a travel itinerary. Google maps directions API is used to create a trevel route between the cities as well as a marker layer map. The project is currently in beta testing, and getting positive feedback from users.
